      <description>AsyncAPI is an open source initiative that seeks to improve the current state of Event-Driven Architectures (EDA). Our long-term goal is to make working with EDA&amp;rsquo;s as easy as it is to work with REST APIs. That goes from documentation to code generation, from discovery to event management. Most of the processes you apply to your REST APIs nowadays would be applicable to your event-driven/asynchronous APIs too.
To make this happen, the first step has been to create a specification that allows developers, architects, and product managers to define the interfaces of an async API.</description>
