      <description>This post is a collaboration between Fran Méndez of AsyncAPI and Solace’s Jonathan Schabowsky. It was originally published at Solace’s blog.
Jonathan explained in his last blog post how the loose coupling of applications associated with event-driven architecture and publish/subscribe messaging is both a strength and a weakness. As part of that, he touched on the fact that request/reply interactions using RESTful APIs are still the dominant application integration paradigm, even in hybrid cloud, machine learning and IoT use cases that benefit from event-driven interactions.</description>
