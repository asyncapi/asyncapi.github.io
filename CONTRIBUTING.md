## Overview

Contributions are more than welcome. If you want to contribute, please make sure you go through the following steps:

1. Pick or create an issue. 
    - It's always a good idea to leave a message saying that you're going to work on it before you start any actual work.
    - Consider contacting us on [slack](https://www.asyncapi.com/slack-invite/) to discuss the topic first
2. Fork the repository and work there.
3. Open a Pull Request pointing to the `master` branch.
4. A maintainer will review and, eventually, merge your Pull Request. Please, be patient as most of us are doing this in our spare time.

## Conventional commits

This project follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) specification.

Pull requests should have a title that follows the specification, otherwise, merging is blocked. If you are not familiar with the specification simply ask maintainers to modify. You can also use this cheatsheet if you want:

- `blog: ` prefix in the title indicates that PR is only related to blog: new blog post or updating old one.
- `fix: ` prefix in the title indicates that PR is a bug fix.
- `feat: ` prefix in the title indicates that PR is a feature.
- `docs: ` prefix in the title indicates that PR is only related to the documentation.
- `chore: ` prefix in the title indicates that PR is only related to cleanup in the project.
- `test: ` prefix in the title indicates that PR is only related to tests.
- `refactor: ` prefix in the title indicates that PR is only related to refactoring.

Prefix that follows specification is not enough though. Remember that the title must be clear and descriptive with usage of [imperative mood](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#imperative).

Happy contributing :heart:
