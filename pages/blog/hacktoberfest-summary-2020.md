## tl;dr

In October, we welcomed 26 new contributors with 70 pull requests merged. It was exhausting but also fascinating experience. 

## Hacktoberfest Is Ok

Don't be affraid of [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/). It is a great event for both, contributors and maintainers.

There are [haters](https://blog.domenic.me/hacktoberfest/) that will tell you something different. My advice, follow `trimmed mean` measure and always discard extreme opinions, especially if they call for boycotting:

> Finally, and most importantly, we can remember that this is how DigitalOcean treats the open source maintainer community, and stay away from their products going forward

Remember that the fact, that someone is good at programming or works at Google or Facebook, doesn't make them experts in everything. Remember that celebrity is not a good candidate for a role model.

There are no perfect events, there are no best solutions. There is always a place for improvement, but it should be followed by opened civilized discussion.

Let me conclude by saying that I hope the `harm to the open source made by DigitalOcean` is not as big as the harm that such hate does to open source by discouraging new open source contributors. This is just a speculation though, how can I know that any of these things is a harm if I did not conduct any scientific research. I can only confirm tht Hacktoberfest did no harm to [AsyncAPI Initiative](https://www.asyncapi.com/), on a contrary, it was pretty neat.

## Why We Participated in Hacktoberfest

 Our intentions were pretty clear from the very beginning. As I wrote in the [previous post](/blog/hacktoberfest-2020), we wanted to:
 - promote [AsyncAPI Initiative](https://www.asyncapi.com/) as a place where we not only work on the AsyncAPI specification but also lots of tools
 - help members of wider open source community in make their first contributions in a friendly environment

My impression is that sometimes open source is perceived as a kind of elite gathering. This is quite often blocking people from helping, because they feel they cannot help, but rather waste time of others. I was there in the past, it us just another variation of damn [impostor syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome). We wanted to help others to make first baby steps in secure and inclusive environemnt, with lots of patience and support.

## What It Takes To Have 70 PRs Merged

TODO: how much time it took to prepare + work on review and merging

## Was It Worth It

TODO: what was the result of the efforts

## What Made It Such a Success

TODO: provide data from feedback and explain what was most useful

## Hall Of Fame

This is a list of all contibutors that joined AsyncAPI during Hacktoberfest and contribiuted their time to the project. The list is sorted in alphabetic order.

TODO: put here a list of all the users and how many PRs they did. Would be great to do it with their avatars display, like we have in our contributors sections in readmes.
